# Perth Housing Market from 2005 to 2020

In this project, some data visualisations are presented in regards to Perth Metro Housing Market. 

The most popular house styles are identified based on parameters such as number of bedrooms, land size, property age, distance to CBD and suburbs.

Below are some of the questions to be answered based on data analysis related to Perth Properties sold between 2005 and 2020:

1. How the number of bedrooms influence a home's value? 
According to the analysis four bedroom properties were the cheapest considering their price per land ($/m2).

The number of sold four bedroom properties increased from 2015 to 2018. The ratio of sold dwellings with 4 bedrooms remained 1.5 times higher than 3 bedrooms within this period.

I have already found a csv file to start my analysis and will try to find another resource in csv or API format to be able to merge my data and get more appropriate information.

This data analysis could be useful for real estate investors and industry, in general, to know the most potent locations for their investments.
