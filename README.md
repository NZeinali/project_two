# Perth and Melbourne Housing Markets

In this project I will try to gather some data related to house markets and will do a comparison of property markets in Perth and Melbourne. 

I will identify the most popular house styles based on parameters such as number of bedrooms, land size and suburbs.

Some of the following graphs could be created:
    - median housing price per year
    - median housing price per distance from CBD
    - a geomap of the property prices in different suburbs
    - estimate of changes in property prices and the total stock of housing in Perth and Melbourne


I have already found a csv file to start my analysis and will try to find another resource in csv or API format to be able to merge my data and get more appropriate information.

This data analysis could be useful for real estate investors and industry, in general, to know the most potent locations for their investments.
